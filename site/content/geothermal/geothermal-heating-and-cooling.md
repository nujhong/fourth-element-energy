  text: "Geothermal heating and cooling is available all year round. The technology uses a series of pipes buried underground and a heat pump to exchange thermal energy between buildings and the ground. As a more efficient form of heating and cooling compared to conventional systems, we can help to reduce electricity usage, lower emissions and most importantly, lower energy bills for buildings."
