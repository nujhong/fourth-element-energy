Traditionally, a series of pipes called ground heat exchangers (GHEs) are buried underground to exchange thermal energy between the buildings and the ground. These GHEs can be installed in a special drilled borehole, in trenches, or in body of water such as a dam. Contact us to discuss the most suitable type of GHEs for your project.
