title: "We need Geothermal"
text: The world is facing an energy trilemma around emissions reduction, low cost energy, and supply security. The solution is clean and cheap renewable energy. The three elements of large scale renewables are solar, wind and hydro. But what happens when the sun doesn’t shine, the wind doesn’t blow, or we run out of water?

      text: "Geothermal heating and cooling is available all year round. The technology uses a series of pipes buried underground and a heat pump to exchange thermal energy between buildings and the ground. As a more efficient form of heating and cooling compared to conventional systems, we can help to reduce electricity usage, lower emissions and most importantly, lower energy bills for buildings."
